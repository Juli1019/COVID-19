# COVID-19

Coronavirus is a family of viruses that can cause illness, which can vary from common cold and cough to sometimes more severe disease. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) were such severe cases with the world already has faced. SARS-CoV-2 (n-coronavirus) is the new virus of the coronavirus family, which first discovered in 2019, which has not been identified in humans before. It is a contiguous virus which started from Wuhan in December 2019. Which later declared as Pandemic by WHO due to high rate spreads throughout the world. Currently (on the date 15 May 2020), this leads to a total of 300K+ Deaths across the globe, including 159K+ deaths alone in Europe. Pandemic is spreading all over the world; it becomes more important to understand about this spread. This NoteBook is an effort to analyze the cumulative data of confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases over time. In this notebook, the main focus is to analyze the spread trend of this virus all over the world.

ðŸ’¡Project Description:
This project involves analyzing, visualizing, and predicting the trends of COVID-19 cases using Python. It leverages real-world COVID-19 data to study patterns in infection, recovery, and mortality rates globally and regionally (specifically in India). The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and make short-term predictions.

Dataset Info:
The dataset is in CSV format and contains information about:
Confirmed Cases
Deaths
Recoveries
Data separated by countries and regions
The data includes global statistics and country-specific breakdowns, particularly for India.

Problem Statement:
Using the provided dataset, the project focuses on:
Visualizing the Impact:
Analyze and plot trends in the number of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths over time.
Trend Analysis: Identify patterns in the rate of infections and recoveries globally and regionally.
Predictions: Build a predictive model to forecast the number of cases for the next week based on current trends.


Technologies and Tools to Use:
1.Data Handling:
Use Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
Merge multiple datasets if required and preprocess them.

2.Visualization:
Use Plotly for creating interactive and dynamic visualizations (e.g., line plots, bar charts, pie charts).
Show country-wise comparisons, trends over time, and region-specific insights.

3.Time-Series Predictions:
Use the Facebook Prophet Library to build time-series forecasting models.
Predict the number of cases (confirmed, recovered, or deaths) for the next 7 days.


Steps to Implement
1.Data Loading and Cleaning:
Load the CSV dataset using Pandas.
Handle missing data and standardize date formats.
Filter data for global trends and region-specific (India) insights.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore the dataset for trends in infection, recovery, and mortality.
Identify spikes or anomalies in data (e.g., sudden increases in cases).

3.Visualizations:
Create interactive visualizations for:
Daily and cumulative cases globally.
Comparisons between countries/regions.
Recovery rates and death trends.
Specific focus on India.

4.Prediction Models:
Prepare time-series data for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Use Prophet to predict trends for the next week.
Visualize predicted trends with Plotly.

5.Insights and Reporting:
Summarize insights derived from the analysis.
Highlight predictions and compare them to real-world observations.


Outcome
By the end of the project, you will have:
A comprehensive report with interactive visualizations of COVID-19 trends.
Short-term forecasts for case numbers based on the analysis.
Insights into the impact of the pandemic globally and in specific regions.
